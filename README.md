# GvHD-manuscript
Data and R scripts in support of "The immune profile of the gut microbiome in graft versus host disease patients"

## SRP162022_overall_course.Rmd
Script to compute and display overall evolution across the allo-HSCT procedure of the gut microbiome

## ERP017899_conditioning.Rmd
Script looking at the upstream immunosuppressive conditioning influence on the gut microbiome, in relation the aGvHD status

## ERP017899_survival.Rmd
Script fitting random survival forests to baseline microbiomes using right-censored survival, the aim being to extract important taxa.

## Onset_regression.Rmd
Script to extract important species at aGvHD onset, using linear regression

## Onset_modulation.Rmd    
Script covering the extraction of species in differential abundance at aGvHD onset between cases and controls and the in siilico prediction of co-exclusion and co-occurrence between these species and qualified presumption of safety (QPS) species.
